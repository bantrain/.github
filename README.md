# .github - a hidden gem in repository management

All github meta files are stored here and automatically linked from all repositories.

## Missing features, bugs, to-dos:

- Content of `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` is not available in repositories. Bug? Feature? I don't know, because I can't find any documentation about this.
